## AutomaTiles API ##

Since the API is quite short, this is the current documentation for using it. It should be apparent on how to use it from some of the examples, but this can serve as a nice reference while you are writing your first programs for the AutomaTiles. 

**A default blank sketch**
```c
void setup() {  
   setButtonCallback(button); 
   setStepCallback(step);
}

void loop() {
	// continuous time logic here
}

void button() {
	// handle button down here
}

```

### AutomaTile methods ###

**getNeighborStates**
```c
void getNeighborStates(uint8_t * result);
// pass it an array for the size of the neighborhood and it will return each neighbor’s state in that array. 
```
**getTimer**
```c
uint32_t getTimer(void);
// returns a value of time in milliseconds (starts at 0 from battery in) 
```
**setColor**
```c
void setColor(const uint8_t color[3]);
// send this function (R,G,B) 0-255, color will change on next cycle 
```
**setState**
```c
void setState(uint8_t state);
// set the state of self 0-15 (limited due to communication of state and step frequency)
// invalid states are ignored, i.e. return without state change
// NOTE: empty spaces act as tiles of state 0 (treat this accordingly) 
```
**getState**
```c
uint8_t getState(void);
// get’s our own current state, 0-15 
```
**setButtonCallback**
```c
void setButtonCallback(cb_func cb);
// pass your own function to setButtonCallback, this function takes no arguments and returns nothing
// can be set once in the beginning of your application, but can also be hot-swapped during runtime
// defaults to do nothing (change this to default to flash blue)
// NOTE: you cannot delay in the button callback (i.e. timer will not update while you are in the callback) 
```
**setLongButtonCallback**
```c
void setLongButtonCallback(cb_func cb, uint16_t ms);
// pass your own function to setLongButtonCallback, this function takes no arguments and returns nothing
// long button callback will be activated after a button has been pressed for n milliseconds (second parameter)
// can be set once in the beginning of your application, but can also be hot-swapped during runtime
// defaults to do nothing (change this to default to flash blue)
// NOTE: you cannot delay in the button callback (i.e. timer will not update while you are in the callback) 
```
**setLongButtonCallbackTime**
```c
void setLongButtonCallbackTime(uint16_t ms);
// set the amount of time it takes before the longButtonCallback is triggered
// can be hot-swapped during runtime
```
**setTimerCallback**
```c
void setTimerCallback(cb_func cb, uint16_t ms);
// set a custom timed callback, whatever you want, it will fire after a given amount of time
// can be hot-swapped during runtime
```
**setTimerCallbackTime**
```c
void setTimerCallbackTime(uint16_t ms);
// set the time for your callback seperately (maybe you want to update that time after setting it initially, perhaps it evolves over time
// can be hot-swapped during runtime
```
**setTimeout**
```c
void setTimeout(uint8_t seconds);
// sets the amount of time before sleeping in seconds
// defaults to 20 seconds
// if you want the automatile to never sleep send it 0, this will run down your battery 
```
**setMicOn**
```c
void setMicOn(void);
// turns the microphone on (i.e. listens for snaps) 
```
**setMicOff**
```c
void setMicOff(void);
// turns the microphone off (i.e. only steps forward from neighbor notification) 
```
